                I had been awaiting his arrival for a long 9 months. Saying I was over ridden with joy was an untruth I was afraid to bare, So I put on a smile and pretended that the arrival of my child was going to be a good experience. Truth be told I knew my life was about to change forever and I wasn't sure I was going to be a good mother. All these doubts running through my mind was almost draining out the pain of the inconsistent contractions in my belly, my head started spinning a little with the what ifs and possibilities of failure heightened by the anticipation of my son’sarrival. I felt so alone even though I was surrounded by my family, I knew better than anyone that this burden would be mine.

                <br> One two three, breath. I opened my eyes and the look of fear on my father’s face was only there  for a moment, he quickly smiled with excitement and asked if it was time. I told him yes and that I had been timing the contractions for about 15 mins and they were getting stronger and more consistent. He decided that we were going to the hospital and I . After that everything became very chaotic.Within 2hours my munchkin landed on this earth without giving much pain to his mother.
                <br>
                <br> Loved the 9months journey.
